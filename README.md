## Description
I wanted to create a easy to use application that will not only help you save time when creating a readme file but prompt you to add all basic information that a professional readme file would contain. Hopefully this application will help you put out amazing readme files quickly, giving you more time to code!
## Installation 
Using this project is quite easy. Once download, in your command line you will do an npm intall followed by running node in the sever.js file.
## Usage
Use whenever you want to quickly make a readme!
## Contribution Guidelines
Please reach out to me before making any contributions.
## Testing
Once everything is downloaded, you can test it in the command line. If it ran successfully it will tell you a readme file has been created. If it ran into any issues it will also tell you so.
